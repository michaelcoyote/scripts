Personal scripts: Useful things that help me do things.

Some of these scripts are my own creation and are licensed MIT license.

Some of these are created by others and contains their own licensing at the top of the 
file along with any of the origional author's information I can find.

Everything here is "use at your own risk", "park it, lock it, not responsable" and 
"offer not valid in Sectors R and N"
